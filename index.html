The Language button has a tooltip that appears on hover to inform users that other languages will soon be available, but unfortunately the site is only available in English for now. As we want the park to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, it's intended that future work on the project would include adding multiple additional languages. -->

        <!-- The <footer> section appears at the end of the page, and is the same on every page. It contains three columns, enclosed within a <div> called "wrapper". This div controls how the columns are displayed. The first column provides the user with important information about the park such as the opening hours, contact information and an "About Us" section. As there is quite a lot of information here, it has been organized into a <details> structure so the user can expand the section that they're interested in reading. The second section contains a number of important links. Most of these links are non-functional as they go beyond the scope of the project. All links here change colour on hover. Finally the last column also contains links, but these are in the form of images. -->

Details widgets are closed by default, unless the keyword "open" is added to the tag as it is with the Opening Hours section. The details object has 2 sections - a <summary> which defines the content shown when the object is collapsed, and an "accordian_details" div which shows when the user clicks to expand the section. -->

                                        "Voyager" is the largest Space-themed Amusement park in Europe. We were established back in 2010, here in a wonderful place, called Greenburg. Every year we are delighted to welcome thousands of Guests from all around the World.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "Space" is our world. "Space" is the air, which we breathe. "Space" is all around us, here at "Voyager". "Space is the Place"! And our customers, our "Spaciarians", know that. Here they can discover planets, stars, and constellations in our Virtual Reality Planetarium. Moreover, they can experience real reduced gravity and even try out a real space suit in our two Simulators- SpaceWalk and MoonWalk.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Have you ever wondered how it feels to be on the International Space Station? Well... there is no need to wonder any longer- we have a Space Shuttle, which takes our "Spaciarians" straight to the International Space Station.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our youngest "Spaciarians" and their parents will especially love our Lunar Rovers which take you on a mysterious journey straight into the Universe. "Spaciarians" looking for more educational journey can experience our Mars Habitat, which will reveal to you the secrets of the Red Planet. But that's not all! There are three more surprises waiting for you- the Mars Colony Experience, our G-Force Rocket Coaster, and a Zero-Gravity Chamber.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We employ more than 5000 "Spacemployees", who you will meet not only during your space journey, but also in Auditorium, Garden, Lounge Area, Bar, Restaurant, Shop, Childcare facilities, Locker Rentals, and Parking. We are accessible to everyone, and every year we aim to increase the accessibility of our services.
                                        So, what are you waiting for? Come and join us in this marvelous journey in the "Space". Because...- Yes, you are right! <b>"Space is the Place"!</b>
