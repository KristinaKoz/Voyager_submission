        <!-- HEADER -->
        <!-- The <header> section of the page is used to define the content that proceeds the main content of the page. It can include elements like branding, navigation or a search bar for example. In our site, our header contains a logo, a notice about today's opening hours, a music control button, a shopping cart icon, a language option button and the main navigation. -->
        <header>
            <!-- LOGO -->
            <!-- The logo is contained within a <div> tag which makes it easier to move it within our header. It's also contained within an <a> tag - it's common to use a hyperlink on the main site logo to hyperlink users page to the homepage. The logo is a .gif file which is set to repeat only once so it just plays on page load. In order to play the GIF on page load, 3 copies of the GIF were created, one for each page to remove caching issues. -->

            <!-- This <div> is shown on the right hand side of the header and contains two buttons- the shopping cart and the language icon. Having both buttons within the same div makes it easier to style them. The shopping cart button is an image enclosed within <a> tags which means that if users click that button they'll be redirected to the Booking page. The Language button has a tooltip that appears on hover to inform users that other languages will soon be available, but unfortunately the site is only available in English for now. As we want the park to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, it's intended that future work on the project would include adding multiple additional languages. -->

                                "Voyager" is the largest Space-themed Amusement park in Europe. We were established back in 2010, here in a wonderful place, called Greenburg. Every year we are delighted to welcome thousands of Guests from all around the World.
                            </p>

                                "Space" is our world. "Space" is the air, which we breathe. "Space" is all around us, here at "Voyager". "Space is the Place"! And our customers, our "Spaciarians", know that. Here they can discover planets, stars, and constellations in our Virtual Reality Planetarium. Moreover, they can experience real reduced gravity and even try out a real space suit in our two Simulators- SpaceWalk and MoonWalk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Have you ever wondered how it feels to be on the International Space Station? Well... there is no need to wonder any longer- we have a Space Shuttle, which takes our "Spaciarians" straight to the International Space Station.
